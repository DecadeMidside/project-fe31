              Breitling`s new Aviation Pioneers Squad is made up of three
              remarkable individuals who represent different airborne
              disciplines but all define an incredible new age of adventure in
              the air: Scott Kelly spent a year of his life looking down at the
              Earth from the International Space Station (ISS). <br />
              Commandant Rocío González Torres has logged more than 1000 hours
              of flight time in a fighter jet and is proud to be a role model
              for girls and young women determined to conquer the skies.
              Finally, Luke Bannister excels in a whole new aviation discipline;
              he won his first World Drone Championship at the age of 15, and
              has been on a winning course ever since. Breitling’s Surfer Squad
              members reflect the dynamic values of the brand: action, purpose,
              and pioneering spirit. They also share our commitment to
              maintaining clean oceans and beaches. These surfers personify
              Breitling’s passion for the sea which, along with air and land, is
              one of our thematic pillars. The squad includes American Kelly
              Slater, the most successful surfer of all time, as well as two
              brilliantly talented Australian women, Stephanie Gilmore and Sally
              Fitzgibbons. <br /> Breitling has also enhanced its environmental
              engagement with a partnership with Outerknown, a sustainable
              apparel manufacturer co-founded by Kelly Slater.

              The members of the Explorer Squad have achieved incredible

              The 1960s was a decade of experimentation, fun, freedom and
              energy. Whether cruising on a motorcycle or revving up a
              sportscar, living life at full speed was the order of the day.
              Third-generation founder Willy Breitling felt this change of pace
              and set out to design an unconventional chronograph that captured
              the verve of era. He called it the Top Time. Speed ahead to today.
              Breitling partners with some of the coolest names in wheels to
              create its Top Time designs. <br /> The Top Time Classic Cars
              watches feature the colors and emblems of their 1950s and ’60s
              sportscar influences—and all now come with a brag-worthy new
              engine under the hood: the Breitling Manufacture Caliber 01. Meet
              the cars behind the collection.The Ford Thunderbird was unveiled
              in 1954 at the first post-war Detroit auto show. It was touted as
              a fun-to-drive cabriolet that made its presence felt through its
              luxurious design, solid build and dramatic tailfin. The
              Thunderbird wasn’t so much about living life in the fast lane, as
              it was about cruising in comfort and style. The two first
              generations remain the most collectable models, nicknamed the
              “Classic Bird” (1955-57) for early two-seaters and the “Square
              Bird” (1958-60) for the later four-seat iterations. <br />
              The first-generation Ford Mustang, produced from 1964 to 1974, was
              compact and sleek. <br />
              With some models suited to families and others ideal for
              speed-loving sportsters, it became the car of choice for hitting
              the road in hip 1960s America. It also featured in some of the
              era’s most popular movies. This living legend is still in
              production, but car buffs know that the coolest of all were those
              very first models that captured the freewheeling spirit of the
              Sixties. The second-generation Chevrolet Corvette, from the 1963
              to 1967 model years, is the most sought-after version of the
              Breitling.
